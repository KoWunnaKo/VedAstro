        <h4 class="fw-bold">Three Factors</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width:@AppData.MaxWidth;">
            In selecting horoscopes for marriage purposes, three factors have to be
            carefully considered. They are: -
            <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
                <li class="list-group-item">The longevity of the bride and the bridegroom.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">The larger strength of the 7th and 8th houses.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Agreeability in regard to the Kutas or Pooruththam.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h4 class="fw-bold">Longevity</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width:@AppData.MaxWidth;">
            When there is no longevity in the case of bride, the horoscope must be
            rejected even though the 7th house may be strong or the requsite
            number of units are available. Likewise when the 7th house is weak and
            is considerably blemished, the horoscope to be matched should have
            antidotes or counteracting influences.
        </p>

        <h4 id="GrahaMaitram" class="fw-bold">Rasyadhipathi or Graha Maitram</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            This is the most important Kuta
            inasmuch as it deals with the psychological dispositions of the Couple.
            The mental qualities of the parties and their affection for each other are
            admittedly of vital importance to their happiness. This must be tested
            before marriage. In considering Graha Maitram the friendship or
            otherwise between the lords of the Janma Rasis of the persons
            concerned is very important.
            Some suggest that in considering the planetary relations, the temporary
            dispositions should also be taken into account. This in my humble
            opinion is not necessary, because, the entire subject of adaptability
            hinges on the birth constellations and not on birth charts as a whole.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Rajju" class="fw-bold">Rajju</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            This indicates the strength or duration of married life and
            therefore it merits special attention. The 27 constellations have been
            grouped into five types of Rajju.
            The Janma Nakshatras of the couple should not fall in the same Rajju. If
            they fall in Sira (head) husband's death is likely; if in Kantha (neck) the
            wife may die; if in Udara (stomach) the children may die; if in Kati
            (waist) poverty may ensue; and if in Pada (foot) the couple may be
            always wandering. Hence, it is desirable that the boy and the girl have
            constellations belonging to different Rajjus or groups.
        </p>

        <h4 id="NadiKuta" class="fw-bold">Nadi Kuta</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            This is considered to be the most important and at the
            same time the most significant Kuta. In Sanskrit, Nadi means several
            things but in reference to astrology, it signifies pulse or nervous energy
            indicating the physiological and to a certain extent hereditary factors.
            The Hindu medical works enumerate three Nadis or humours, viz.,
            Vatha (wind), Pitha (bile) and Sleshma (phlegm). A boy with a
            predominantly windy or phlegmatic or bilious constitution should not
            marry a girl of the same type. The girl should belong to a different
            temperament. The three Nadis are ruled by the different constellations.
        </p>
        <h4 id="VasyaKuta" class="fw-bold">Vasya Kuta</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            This is important as suggesting the degree of magnetic
            control or amenability the wife or husband would be able to exercise on
            the other. For Aries - Leo and Scorpio are amenable. For Taurus -
            Cancer and Libra; for Gemini - Virgo; for Cancer - Scorpio and
            Sagittarius; for Leo - Libra; for Virgo - Pisces and Gemini; for Libra -
            Capricorn and Virgo; for Scorpio - Cancer; for Sagittarius - Pisces; for
            Capricorn - Aries and Aquarius; for Aquarius - Aries; arid for Pisces -
            Capricorn.
        </p>

        <h4 id="DinaKuta" class="fw-bold">Dina Kuta</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            The word "Dina"" simply means day and refers to the day to day living and sharing.
            Count the constellation of the boy from that of the girl
            and divide the number by 9. If the remainder is 2, 4, 6, 8 or 0 it is good.
            The number of units of compatibility assigned to this Kuta is 3 in case
            agreement is found.
        </p>
        <h4 id="GunaKuta" class="fw-bold">Guna Kuta</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            This seems to have an important bearing on the
            temperament and character of the couple concerned. A difference of temperament may be harmonious and
            complimentary. But a compatibility of temperament is essential to a
            satisfactory marriage union. Astrologically three Gunas (temperaments
            of natures) are recognized viz., Deva (divine), Manusha (human), and
            Rakshasa (diabolical). Deva represents piety, goodness of character
            end charitable nature. Manusha is a mixture of good and bad, while
            Rakshasa suggests dominance, self-will and violence. These different
            natures are indicated by the birth, constellation. A distaste for piety and
            religious disposition cannot be easily associated with piety and religious
            nature. A difference in beliefs and dogmas cannot always be
            overbalanced by sexual compatibility. Hence one born in a Deva
            constellation is not able to get on well with a person born in Rakshasa
            constellation. A Deva can marry a Deva, a Manusha can marry a
            Manusha and a Rakshasa can marry a Rakshasa.
            Manusha or a Deva man should not marry a Rakshasa girl unless there
            are other neutralizing factors. But marriage between a Rakshasa man
            and a Deva or Manusha girl is passable. If marriage is brought about
            between prohibited Ganas there will be quarrels and disharmony. So
            that the couple would always welcome an opportunity for separation and
            divorce.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Mahendra" class="fw-bold">Mahendra</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            Mahendra Porutham tells us about the ability of a couple to have good children or
            good progeny is indicated by this porutham/kuta.
            The constellation of the boy counted from that of the girl
            should be the 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, 19th, 22nd or 25th. This
            promotes well-being and increases longevity.
        </p>

        <h4 id="StreeDeergha" class="fw-bold">Stree-Deergha</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            In sanskrit "Stree" means Girl &amp; "Dheerga" is Blessed forever.
            As such this kuta/porutham ensures the female counterpart's well being, longevity and prosperity.

            The boy's constellation should preferably be beyond
            the 9th from that of the girl. According to some authorities the distance
            should be more than 7 constellations.

            Exception: - This consideration may be ignored if Rasi Kuta and Graha
            Maitram obtain.
        </p>

        <h4 id="RasiKuta" class="fw-bold">Rasi Kuta</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            If the Rasi of the boy happens to be the 2nd from that of
            the girl and if the Rasi of the girl happens to be the 12th from that of the
            boy, evil results will follow. But if, on the other hand, the Rasi of the boy
            falls in the 12th from the girl's or the Rasi of the girl is in the 2nd from
            that of the boy astrology predicts longevity for the couple. If the Rasi of
            the boy is the 3rd from that of the girl. there will be misery and sorrow.
            But if the Rasi of the girl is the 3rd from that of the boy, there will be
            happiness. If the boy's falls in the 4th from that of the girl's, then there
            will be great poverty; but if the. Rasi of the girl happens to fall in the 4th
            from the boy's there will be great wealth. If the boy's Rasi falls in the 5th
            from that of the girl, there will be unhappiness. But if the girl's Rasi falls
            in the 5th from that of the boy, there will be enjoyment and prosperity.
            But where the Rasis of the boy and the girl are in the 7th houses
            mutually, then there will be health, agreement and happiness. If the
            boy's Rasi falls in the 6th from the girl's there will be loss of children, but
            if the girl's is the 6th from the boy's, then the progeny will prosper.

            Exception: - When both the Rasis are owned by one planet or if the
            lords of the two Rasis happen to be friends, the evil attributed above to
            the inauspicious disposition of Rasis gets cancelled.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Vedha" class="fw-bold">Vedha</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            This means affliction. Certain constellations are capable of
            affecting or afflicting certain other constellations situated at particular
            distances from them; For instance, Aswini is said to cause Vedha to the
            18th constellation (viz., Jyeshta) from it; Bharani to the 16th (viz.,
            Anuradha) and so on. The following pairs of constellations affect each
            other and, therefore, no marriage should be brought about between a
            boy and girl who's Janma Nakshatras belong to the same pair unless the
            are other relieving factors.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Varna" class="fw-bold">Varna</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            This seems to signify the degree of spiritual or ego
            development of the marrying partners. Pisces, Scorpio and Cancer
            represent the highest development - Brahmin; Leo, Sagittarius and Libra
            indicate the second grade - or Kshatriya; Aries, Gemini and Aquarius
            suggest the third or the Vaisya; while Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn
            indicate the last grade, viz., Sudra. A girl belonging to a higher grade of
            spiritual development should not be mated to a boy of lesser
            development. The vice verse or both belonging to the same grade or
            degree is allowed.
        </p>

        <h4 id="YoniKuta" class="fw-bold">Yoni Kuta</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            Yoni Kuta is for sexual compatibility. The sexual urge of a person born for instance in Chitta is
            supposed to be as strong as that of a tiger. The human embryo in
            course of its development passes through the various stages of
            evolution - mammals, quadrupeds, etc., so that the tendencies of certain
            animals will be predominant The birth constellation seems to show this
            predominance. Each sign and degree of the zodiac expresses the
            degree of evolution of the individual concerned. Thus, one born in Leo
            will have in him the characteristics of a lion while the other born in Aries
            will be timid and mild. It is these biological influences that seem to be at
            the root of all astrological considerations. If both the couple belong to
            the male constellations, there will be frequent quarrels and want of
            agreement in sex-matters. So the best way is to mate a male belonging
            to a male constellation with a female belonging to a female
            constellation. Therefore the Yoni Kuta takes into account the sexual aspect of
            marriage and indicates the sex affinities such as the degree of sex-urge,
            sex-compatibility, the size of copulatory organs and so on.
            This reveals to us the importance of Yoni Kuta. All the 27 constellations
            have been assigned certain animals. Marriage between the constellations indicating same class of yoni and
            between the male and female stars of that yoni said to conduce to great
            happiness, perfect harmony and progeny. If the male and female
            happen to be born in friendly Yonis, but both representing female
            constellations there will be fair happiness and agreement. If the couple
            belong both to male constellations there will be constant quarrels and
            unhappiness. If marriage takes place between constellations indicating
            unfriendly Yonis it is better marriage is avoided. For example, if marriage
            takes place between a male born in Moola and female born in Aridra it
            will turn out a very happy. The constellations Moola and Aridra
            represent the male and female organs of a dog. The union of these is
            agreeable and conduces to favourable results to the fullest extent. If
            marriage takes place between a man born in the constellation
            Satabhisha and a girl born in Punarvasu, both representing the female
            stars, the marriage is passable but not so good as in the first instance.
            Marriages between parsons belonging to constellations indicating
            inimical yonis are not recommended.
        </p>

        <h4 id="KujaDosha" class="fw-bold">Kuja Dosha</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            The position of Venus and Mars is very important in judging marital
            relations. Mars whose element is fire rules marriage. Where he is badly
            situated or associated in the horoscope of a male or female, it follows
            that the sacerdotal fire gets extinguished soon. Such unfavourable
            situation goes under the name of Kuja Dosha.

            It must be noted that in determining marriage adaptability between two
            parties, there are several elements of much more importance than Kuja
            Dosha. And the evil influences occuring from the bad position of Mars is
            only one of the several elements.

            So far as our humble experience goes it is only in the Kerala Sastra that
            mention is made of Kuja Dosha. The stanza runs thus:
            Dhana vyayecha pathale jamitre chashtame kuja; Strinam bharthru vinasamcha
            bharthunam strivinasanam.
            This means: - "If Mars is in the 2nd, 12th,
            4th, 7th and 8th houses in the horoscope of the female, the death of the
            husband will occur; similar situation in the husband's horoscope causes
            the death of wife."

            The Lagna represents body, the Moon, mind and Venus, sexual
            relations. Therefore, the houses have to be reckoned with reference to
            all the three, viz., Lagna, Moon and Venus. The dosha (evil) is
            considered weak when it exists from Lagna, a little stronger from the
            Moon and still more powerful from Venus.

            The second house signifies family; the twelth represents comforts and
            pleasures of bed. The fourth rules sukha or happiness. The seventh
            indicates husband and eighth represents longevity of the wife or
            husband. Hence the position of Mars in these houses is supposed to
            produce this peculiar dosham or evil. If Kuja Dosham obtains in the
            horoscopes of both the bride and bridegroom, the dosham gets
            cancelled.

            There are, of course, many good combinations which assure
            marital felicity and much importance need not be given to Kuja Dosham.
            Granting that Kuja Dosham is a factor whose occurrence should not be
            ignored, there are antidotes which are not generally known to the rank
            and file of Hindu astrologers.

            The exceptions are:
            Mars in the 2nd can
            be said to be bad provided such 2nd house is any other than Gemini
            and Virgo; in the 12th the dosha is produced when such 12th house is
            any other than Taurus and Libra in the 4th house Mars causes dosha
            provided the house falls in any sign other than Aries and Scorpio; when
            the 7th is other than Capricorn and Cancer, the dosha is given rise to;
            and Mars gives bad effects in the 8th, provided the 8th is any other than
            Sagittarius and Pisces. In Aquarius and Leo, Mars produces no dosha
            whatsoever. The dosha is counteracted by the conjunction of Mars and
            Jupiter or Mars and the Moon; or by the presence of Jupiter or Venus in
            the ascendant.

            Thus, it will be seen that Kuja Dosha does not deserve that
            consideration which is now being paid to it. In the consideration of
            marriage adaptability there are various other factors which should be
            carefully examined.

        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            There is a belief current amongst the public that girls born in certain
            constellations cause the death of certain relatives. For instance, a girl
            born in Visakha is said to bring about the destruction of her husband's
            younger brother so that parents generally try to find out a bridegroom
            who does not have a younger brother. Even when there are other merits
            in the horoscope, it is rejected on the simple ground that the girl is born
            in Visakha. This is entirely due to ignorance of the real astrological
            factors governing such considerations. Only certain Padas or quarters
            should be held inauspicious and not the entire constellation. Thus, in
            regard to Visakha, only the last quarter is evil and not the first three.
            Therefore a girl born in the first three quarters of Visakha should not be
            considered to bring misfortune to her husband's younger brother.
            Similarly, the boy or girl born in the first quarter of Moola is to be
            rejected as it is said to cause the death of the father-in-law. The last
            three quarters of Moola are beneficial. A girl born in Jyeshta is said to
            cause evil to her husband's elder brother. Almost all authors agree that
            (certain parts of) Moola, Astesha, Jyeshta and Visakha are destructive
            constellations - Moola (first quarter) for husband's father; Aslesha (first
            quarter) for husband's mother; Jyeshta (first quarter) for girl's husband's
            elder brother; and Visakha (last quarter) for husband's younger brother.

        <p class="text-justify mb-4" style="max-width: @AppData.MaxWidth;">
            When Mars and Venus are in the 7th, the boy or girl concerned will have strong sex instincts
            and such an individual should be mated to one who has similar
            instincts and not a person having Mercury or Jupiter in the 7th, as this
            makes one under-sexed. When sexual incompatibility sets in marriage,
            life proves charmless and friction arises between the couple.
